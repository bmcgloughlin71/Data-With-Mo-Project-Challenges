# Data-With-Mo-Project-Challenges
My attempts at tackling the Data Analysis Coding Challenge Projects from Data With Mo [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObV_hwu2QM)

Coding With Mo proposes 5 different data analysis challange projects to add to your portfolio with 2 options for each project.

The 5 that I wish to attempt are:

## Project 1 (Data Cleaning and Transformation) 
### Data science job postings on Glassdoor

For this project Data with Mo provides the following guiding questions:

- Can you make the salary column into integers?
- What information can you extract out of job descriptions?
- How can you remove the numbers from the company name?
- How can you create some new feature? (e.g. state column from each location column)


## Project 2 (Data Analysis)
### Stack Overflow annual developer survey

For this project Data with Mo provides the following guiding questions:

- At what companies do developers get paid the most?
- How much does remote working matter to employees?
- What's the most popular method of learning to code?
- Are you more likely to get a job as a developer if you have a master's degree?

## Project 3 (Data Visualization) (WIP)
### London bike sharing dataset

For this project Data with Mo provides the following guiding questions:

- How does the weather affect bike usage?
- What's the total number of bike rides between specific periods?
- What's the 2-week moving average? (7-day/30-day moving average?)
- How can you make your visuals more dynamic and more-user friendly?

## Project 4 (Data Engineering / Data Science) (WIP)
### Credit card approval prediction

For this project Data with Mo provides the following guiding questions:

- The data is very unbalanced. How can you overcome this problem?
- How do you define if a customer is good or bad?
- How do you build a machine learning model that predicts if the applicant is good or bad?

## Project 5 (Communication) (WIP)

- Can you build your own website? 


For each project I want to at least succeed in providing solutuons to all of the guiding questions and if possible see what additional things I can learn from each data set.
