# Data-With-Mo-Project-Challenges
My attempts at tackling the Data Analysis Coding Challenge Projects from Coding With Mo [Youtube Channel: ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObV_hwu2QM)

Coding With Mo proposes 5 different data analysis challange projects to add to your portfolio with 2 options for each project.

The 5 that I wish to attempt are:

## Project 1 
### Data science job postings on Glassdoor

For this project Data with Mo provides the following guiding questions:

- Can you make the salary column into integers?
- What information can you extract out of job descriptions?
- How can you remove the numbers from the company name?
- How can you create some new feature? (e.g. state column from each location column)


For each project I want to at least succeed in providing solutuons to all of the guiding questions and if possible see what additional things I can learn from each data set.
